## Overview

The mission of **Project BioRegen** is to provide an easy-to-use platform that connects people and businesses with services that collect their food waste. Once collected, the waste is sent to specialized companies that convert it into valuable products such as fertilizers and renewable energy. We aim to make a significant contribution to reducing food waste and promoting a circular economy by turning waste into resources.

We offer three key services:
1. **Connect**: We connect individuals, restaurants, and businesses that generate food waste with certified waste collection services.
2. **Collect**: We facilitate the collection of food waste from the designated locations at scheduled times.
3. **Convert**: The collected food waste is processed by our partner companies that specialize in waste-to-energy and fertilizer production.
